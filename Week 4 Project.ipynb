Shopping centers provide customers with a wide variety of options including dining, grocery shopping, movies, and fashion/clothes outlets.  So instead of residents traveling to multiple places to get their necessary things, they can just go to a mall where they can accomplish everything on their to do list without traveling from store to store.  For retailers, the shopping center location is a crucial aspect to a mall being successful.  Successful shopping centers tend to be located in a high population area so more customers can shop there.  With the population of Pittsburgh increasing yearly, more and more shopping centers are being built across the entire city.  This also affects property developers because building in close proximity to shopping centers increases their value.  Of course, many factors should be considered before blindly building a shopping center within a densely populated area.  However, the location of the shopping center has historically been a significant influencer of whether it will be a successful business or not."

The beautifulsoup packages and requests from Python will help with the extraction process.  In order to obtain the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighborhoods, the Python Geocoder package will be used.  Once the spatial coordinates are obtained, we will use the Foursquare API to get the venue data for the Pittsburgh neighborhoods.  With this particular dataset, we will be focused on the shopping center/mall category of venue data to solve our business problem.  In the next section, I will discuss in more detail the specific methods that will be used in this capstone project, such as machine learning and data visualization.      "
